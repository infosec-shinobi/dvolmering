# Welcome

I appreciate you stopping by! This is my little slice of the internet that I am calling home and using to capture my random tidbits of knowledge that I pick up along my journey. 

## Possible Post Content

Topics covered will be wide and vary on what day of the week and what is currently peaking my interest. Current hobbies include:

* BJJ
* Python
* Kubernetes
* AWS/Cloud
* Automating all the things (including this site)
* Whiskey
* Food

## Why

I have had a domain for many years. I have told myself I would create a site many times... With the new year, I am buckling down and finally committing to maintaining a website (or at least attempting to), if only to help myself better remember neat things I learn or cool projects I undertook.

Hoping for plenty of love and beautiful sunsets in 2023.
